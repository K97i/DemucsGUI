# DemucsGUI
Simple WPF program to open Demucs that is installed on the running computer with the parameters

I made this for myself, as I can't remember the arguments for Demucs aside from needing to add the path to the file. 
[Feel free to use this!](https://github.com/K97i/DemucsGUI/releases/latest/download/DemucsGUI.exe)

Note for those who are gonna actually use this:

**THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT CONTAIN DEMUCS ITSELF.** 

It is simply a GUI that launches Demucs that is already installed on the machine.
If you don't want to mess with command line stuff, you can let the program install Demucs for you.

Be warned though, Demucs's file size is bigger than you think.

I am a terrible programmer so fellow nerds, god save you if you look into the source code.
