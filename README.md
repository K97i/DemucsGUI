# DemucsGUI
Simple WPF program to open Demucs that is installed on the running computer with the parameters

I made this for myself, as I can't remember the arguments for Demucs aside from needing to add the path to the file.

I am a terrible programmer so fellow nerds, god save you if you look into the source code.
